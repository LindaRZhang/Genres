# Music Genre Categorization

An project for categorizing music genres, inspired by [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com/) by Glenn McDonald.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive and community-driven categorization of music genres. It's designed to be used in applications like playlist analysis tools, music recommendation systems, and other music-related projects.

## Features

- Extensive list of music genres from Spotify
- Hierarchical categorization of genres
- Easy format for easy integration with various projects

## Usage

The main data file is `genre.js`, which contains a JavaScript object with genre categorizations. You can use this in your projects by importing it.
- Keys are main genres (e.g., "pop", "jazz", "hip hop")
- Values are arrays of subgenres belonging to that main genre
- An "Other" category is included for genres that do not fit neatly into existing categories or are less commonly recognized
